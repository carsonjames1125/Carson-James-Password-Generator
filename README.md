# Carson James Password Generator


## Description
---
- In this challenge, we were given the HTML, CSS, and JS files as our starter code. Using this starter code we were asked to create working logic and functions to develop a password generator with said code. The motivation for this project was to make sure that the webapp gives the user what they want and usablity to customize their random password however they please. The reason I built this project was to learn more about javascript and the applications it has within websites. It also helped me understand the power javascript has and how it can be used to allow a website to function. The problem at hand was solved by using variables of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in arrays as possible outcomes for the password. Along with that, creating several if/else statements and functions to make the possibilities come to life and produce a working password generator. 

## Installation
---
- To get the project up and running I changed the styling of the HTML to give it a more welcoming feel. After that, I went in the .js file to give the html logic and functions. Once I was happy with the results after running a few tests with different options and outcomes, I pushed everything to github. Once all of my work was in the github repository, I migrated to the pages section, and pushed the repository live.
